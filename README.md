### Inspiration
The City of Boston has a large number of homeless people. Especially in the winter, it can be really hard to find a warm place to sleep, good nourishing food and also educational events that are offered. This is really unfortunate because there are so many great charities, events, and resources, that are scattered throughout the city and the internet. We wanted to make this valuable information more accessible, by gathering and putting this information together in order to make it just a little easier to find food or a warm bed in the Hub.

### What it does
The website we've built provides a medium for those in need to find various resources such as food, shelter, healthcare, and community support. Additionally, organizations, families, students or whoever wants to give back to the community can register events and donations in seconds.
